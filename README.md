# Fibonacci-Series-value-and-number-of-calls-in-the-recursive-function
My own CPP Program to "find the value and number of calls in the recursive Fibonacci Series".
It is a bug-free and errorless program.
My program is working perfectly.

PURPOSE:
It is a program which outputs all the Fibonacci Series values and also the number calls it had taken in the recursive function. I have done this program because "the computer can handle the task '1000 times' faster than humans" and also there wouldnot be any mistakes when the task is handled by computer.

TASK:
It has ability to find the "value" and the "number of calls" when the user enters the Fibonacci Series number.
User can also enter the multiple inputs while running the program once (do-while loop is used).

It is designed as a user friendly.
